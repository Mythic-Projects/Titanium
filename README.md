# Titanium ![Titanium CI](https://github.com/TitanVale/Titanium/actions/workflows/build_titanium.yml/badge.svg)

Titanium is [SportPaper](https://github.com/Electroid/SportPaper) fork which aims to be fast, fix exploits and bugs, improve API, and provide better configuration for server administrators. 

*Titanium officially supports JDK **8**, **11** & **17**.*

## Getting Titanium

Currently, you have to build Titanium by yourself. In the future Download option will be available.

### Requirements

If you want to build Titanium you will need these things to be installed and available from your shell:
* [JDK 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java8)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)

### How to build

To patching, compiling and building Titanium you will use `titanium` script.

To just build Titanium clone this repository and run `titanium build paperclip` in the root directory. Then you will find your server jar in `Titanium-Server/target`, it should be named `titanium-paperclip.jar`.
