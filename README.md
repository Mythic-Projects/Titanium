# Titanium ![Titanium CI](https://github.com/TitanVale/Titanium/actions/workflows/build_titanium.yml/badge.svg) [![Discord Shield](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/982930890780966922/widget.png?style=shield)](https://discord.gg/VYTTRFYJE7)

Titanium is 1.8.8 [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper) fork which aims to improve performance, fix exploits and bugs, improve API and provide better configuration for server administrators. 

*Titanium officially supports JDK **8**, **11** & **17*** - but we recommend to use *Java 17*.

## Download

Latest version of Titanium - [Releases page](https://github.com/TitanVale/Titanium/releases). <br>
Dev versions (less stable, but with newer patches) - [Jenkins](https://jenkins.titanvale.net/job/Titanium/job/dev)

## Building

#### Requirements

If you want to build Titanium you will need these things to be installed and available from your shell:
* [JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)

#### How to
To patching, compiling and building Titanium you will use `titanium` script.

To just build Titanium clone this repository and run `./titanium build paperclip` in the root directory. Then you will find your server jar in `Titanium-Server/build/libs`, it should be named `titanium.jar`.
